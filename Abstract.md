Cold calling a company is inherently a difficult task. It is widely known among salesmen that being friendly can lead to higher rates of 'successful' sales. Cold callers wishing to successfully land another meeting, pitch a service, or sell a product want to know some of the other contributing factors that they could improve upon that would ultimately lead to a 'successful' call.  This research seeks to identify other contributing factors to 'successful' sales by analyzing both audio and transcript data for 'successful' and 'unsuccessful' sales calls. To find the most predictive features, we will compare results of various machine learning algorithms on various feature sets. The feature vectors will be constructed using metrics from both audio and transcript data such as speech rate, sentiment, psychological word categories, pitch, energy, frequency spectrums, etc. By increasing the accuracy of call outcome prediction, companies and their salesmen can tailor their approach to the customer. This could provide a deeper, more positive customer experience, which ultimately leads to more sales for the company.
